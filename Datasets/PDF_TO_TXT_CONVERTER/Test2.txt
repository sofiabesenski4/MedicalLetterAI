Re: Andrea Tester
01 October 1947

Dear Jim:

Thank you very much for asking me to be involved in the care of your patient, Andrea Tester2 and
the management of her persistent atrial ﬁbrillation.

As you are aware, this is a 66-year-old woman with the following past medical history:
1. Atrial ﬁbrillation.
a. CHADS2 score is 0, CHADS-VASc score equals 2 — is currently on apixaban.
b. Rate controled with metoprolol, atenolol, verapamil, diltiazem and most recently
bisoprolol but ineffective.
c. No history of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, strokes, TIAs, myocardial
infarctions or peripheral vascular disease.

(1. Thyroxine from August 2013 was normal,
e. Exercise treadmill test in February 2012 was normal.
f. Negative obstructive sleep apnea test.

2. GERD.

3. Benign breast mass, resected many years ago.

4. Diverticulosis.

5. Acne

The patient reports that she was diagnosed with atrial ﬁbrillation in Sept 2009. She reports that
when she is in it, she feels very poorly with fatigue, being held back, developing heaviness and
discomfort in her chest. She has not had any syncope. She says that with cardioversion, she feels
signiﬁcantly better. She was cardioverted three times in November as well as went to the
emergency department in January where more aggressive rate control was taken. She believes that
she has been in atrial ﬁbrillation for at least a number of months.

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a nonsmoker, has not used alcohol for months, and uses no illegal
drugs or caffeine. She works as a professional taxi driver.

FAMILY HISTORY: Her eldest sister died of myocardial infarction suddenly at age 67, Her
brother had a myocardial infarction at age 72.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical exam today reveals a blood pressure of 120/85. She
has an irregular heart rate at 90 beats a minute. Her JVP is 2 cm. She has clear lungs. She has no
swelling of the ankles. She has an irregular 81, S2, but I cannot appreciate any extra heart sounds
or murmurs.

ECG: ECG done today shows atrial ﬁbrillation at 90 beats a minute. She has a narrow QRS
complex with no speciﬁc ST- or T-wave changes.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM: Echocardiogram done in December 2012 — sinus rhythm with left atrial
size of 4.2 cm. She has a sclerotic aortic valve without aortic stenosis, normal mitral and tricuspid
valve. Mild TR, mild PR. Normal biventricular size and systolic function.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN: With respect to this patient, there are the following issues:

1.

Anticoagulation — We explained that as she is over the age of 65, she should be
anticoagulated. We discussed the use of warfarin vs NOAC. After discussing this in detail,
she would like to start Apixaban. I have sent her for renal function and she will contact the
Aﬁb clinic after to see if her Cr is normal. If so, she will start Apixaban 5mg PO BID.
Symptoms — the patient is quite symptomatic despite aggressive attempts at rate control.
Consequently, I think a rhythm control strategy would be ideal. I outlined for her the
approach to this and explained that we would always try an antiarrhythmic drug prior to an
ablation. I did discuss brieﬂy the antiarrhythmic drugs including the le, sotalol,
amiodarone, and dronedarone. Of these, my ﬁrst choice would be a 1C agent given that
she has had an exercise treadmill test which did not show any signiﬁcant ischemic changes
and she is already on a small dose of bisoprolol. I did explain to her that there is a risk of
this developing atrial ﬂutter at faster rate. Consequently, it is important that she stay on
the bisoprolol with this.

I also outlined for her ablation explaining the success for single procedure is in the order of
50% to 60%. With multiple procedures, this could be increased to around 80%. I
explained that the risks are in the order of 5% to 7% including bleeding or infection at the
site of insertion, myocardial infarction, stroke, tamponade, pneumothorax, need for urgent
open heart surgery, risk of AV node injury such that she would require permanent
pacemaker, esophageal injury, phrenic nerve injury, and pulmonary vein stenosis.

After discussing all this, we have elected to start her on ﬂecainide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. I will
ask the AFib Clinic to contact her to tell her to start this and to ensure that she has a
followup ECG done a couple of days after this has been initiated. I have also ordered her
creatinine and electrolytes.

The plan will be to start her on ﬂecainide and arrange for her to have a cardioversion done
a couple of weeks after the ﬂecainide has been started. If she maintains sinus rhythm with
ﬂecainide, then we will plan to see her back in six months with a Holter monitor prior to
this.

If she is tolerating the ﬂecainide but is not maintaining sinus rhythm, my recommendation
would be to titrate this to 75 or may be even 100 mg b.i.d. To re-cardiovert her and if she
is still having recurrences of atrial ﬁbrillation that we would then book her directly for an
AFib ablation. She is agreeable with this plan.

3. Etiologies — the patient has had her thyroid checked, and there is no signiﬁcant structural
heart disease and obstructive sleep apnea has been ruled out and consequently I do not
think further investigations for etiology need to be undertaken.

Thank you very much for involving me in her care.

Sincerely,
