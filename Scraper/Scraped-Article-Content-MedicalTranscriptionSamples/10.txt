Hypergranulation â€“ Consult
<p><b>CHIEF COMPLAINT:</b>  Non-healing surgical wound to the left posterior thigh.

<b>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: </b> This is a 49-year-old white male who sustained a traumatic injury to his left posterior thighthis past year while in ABCD.  He sustained an injury from the patellar from a boat while in the water.  He was air lifted actually up to XYZ Hospital and underwent extensive surgery.  He still has an external fixation on it for the healing fractures in the leg and has undergone grafting and full thickness skin grafting closure to a large defect in his left posterior thigh, which is nearly healed right in the gluteal fold on that left area.  In several areas right along the graft site and low in the leg, the patient has several areas of hypergranulation tissue.  He has some drainage from these areas.  There are no signs and symptoms of infection.  He is referred to us to help him get those areas under control.

<b>PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:</b>  Essentially negative other than he has had C. difficile in the recent past.

<b>ALLERGIES:</b>  None.
